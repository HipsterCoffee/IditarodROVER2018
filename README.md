## [Iditarod Motorsports ROVER Team](http://iditarodmotorsports.weebly.com/)
Some of this code is sample code from the company Ten80.

#### Communications and Sharing platform used by the Iditarod ROVER Team

### Software Used
Processing: https://processing.org/download/ -used to created coded imagery for the wireless control panel

XCTU: https://www.digi.com/products/xbee-rf-solutions/xctu-software/xctu#productsupport-utilities - used to conect the Wierless X-bees to the computer

Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software - programming the actual movement of the ROVER

### Objectives
* Get the accelometer/gyrometer functioning in a way that is benificial to making the ROVER drive in a straight line

* Enhance the preformance of the wheel Encoder and UltraSonicSensor

* Use the X-bees component to send Arduino code wierlessly to the ROVER
